# Predict the winner of an NFL game with machine learning

## Motivation

Football Season is back!  I love watching football and I geek out on statistics at times. Basketball roo. I'm always curious to predict games based on the team scores.  
I decided to make a case study on building a machine learning model to predict the outcome of NFL games. 
The Components I added to this Football Project are:
- Visualized key game stats
- Created a machine learning model and evaluate its performance
- Tuned the model's hyperparameter
- Identified the most important features

## Content Background
From the data source, "Pro Football Reference", I pulled data on the team, player, and season datasets. 
At the team level, a data point referenced in football are offense and defense production. 
- Offensive Passing Yards
- Offensive Rushing Yards
- Defensive Yards Allowed
- Completion Package
- Passing Attempts
- Turnovers

## Predicting Wins
Can use the trends in team-level stats to predict if a team will win a game.  For modeling, I used Logistic Regression because it is good for predicting binary outcomes
